Overall this project helped me get a sense of what the workplace would be like and how it is important to keep the customer involved throughout the process. The design for this project is very modern and minimalistic. Thanks to feedback from the sponsor, we were able to make this prototype feel revolutionary and modern like the music it is creating. This project also tackled complex interaction and allowed me to put to use my skills as a UI/UX designer. One such interaction is the stream page in which a user needs to be able to quickly create a piece of music and quickly share it with the corresponding musicians. </h2></div></div><div class='row'><div class='col-sm-12'><h3 class='center text_h3'>Interactive Prototype</h3></div></div><div class='row'> <div class='col-sm-12 center'> <iframe style='border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);' width='100%' height='1000px' src='https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2F2Mt0lwDCj9lFyzLTTyh7oN%2FMusic-Notation%3Fpage-id%3D413%253A1995%26node-id%3D413%253A3367%26viewport%3D804%252C1009%252C0.024436939507722855%26scaling%3Dscale-down' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>"
